## DEVELOPER Note 1

`/docs`

-   Use the `/docs` directory to organize all for your R Markdown files,
    which have the extension `.Rmd`.
-   Your R Markdown files are used to create reports that can be
    published on the web as HTML files. That is, R Markdown (.Rmd) --\>
    web page (.html) --\> Published on GitHub in your `/docs` directory.
-   This is the basic workflow:
    -   Go to RStudio
    -   File \> New file \> R Markdown
    -   Edit the file
    -   Save the file in `/docs`
    -   From RStudio, Knit the file (this creates an HTML file for
        publishing)
    -   Push your `/docs` directory to your GitHub repository
-   Once you push your `/docs` directory, you can view your reports in a
    web browser by using an URL like this:
    `https://info-201a-wi22.github.io/final-project/xxx/index.html`

Where: 1. `info-201a-wi22` is the organization 1. `github.io` is a
webserver that GitHub makes available to us 1. `final-project` is the
repository name 1. `xxx` is your GitHub username 1. `index.htlm` is the
document you would like to view

# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Rsconnect](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-8-ad/tree/main/source/rsconnect/shinyapps.io/mmk49) | In using shiny to host our web application, we used r studio connect to publish our work. 
|[World Shape File](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-8-ad/tree/main/source/world_shape_file) | One of our interactive visualizations utilizes a world map. The world shape file provided the template for us to create the visualization. 


# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.

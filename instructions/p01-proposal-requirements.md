#### Abstract:
Our main question is which of the seven deadly sins results is the most profit for social media companies?
This question is important because social media has become a dominating force in our lives to the extent to which it can harm
an individual's mental state, thus making it necessary to understand how sins can harm users. To address the question, we will
make use of datasets that contain information regarding social media profits and social media user bases.

#### Keywords:
seven deadly sins, social media profit, mental health, social media usage, user retention

#### Introduction:
The seven deadly sins, what are they? Declared by the Christian monk Evagrius Ponticus, the sins include: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony,
wrath, and sloth. Our projects goal is to understand the individual effects of the seven deadly sins on major social media platforms. The main question that
we would like to tackle is which of the seven deadly sins results is the most profit for social media companies? Our issue matters because it will allow us
to gain a better understanding of the seven deadly sins in the realm of social media profits and see how companies' use of these sins potentially harm its
users. We plan to address our issue by collecting data on the values of companies and the functions of their social media platforms to ascertain which of
the deadly sins their company falls into and using databases to compare the resulting profits and user counts for the companies.

#### <ins>Problem domain</ins>
&nbsp;
**Background:** Social media has grown to become a prominent
feature in the lives of many adults residing in the United states. Many of us interact with various social media apps in one way or another on a daily basis.
The growth of social media usage is captured by the [Pew Research Center’s Social Media Fact Sheet](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/#social-media-use-over-time). For example, since 2006, the percentage of U.S adults
that have used at least one social media platform skyrocketed from 5% to 72% as of February 8th, 2021. Increases in social media popularity also highlight
the necessity for us to understand how social media is affected by the seven deadly sins. With the increase of social media
a particular group of people are seen using social media the most across all categories of time spent on social media websites, number of social media sites
being used, etc. This group is college-aged users of social media. College-aged social media users face [significant negative mental consequences](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1248481) from heavy
social media usage. Social media then becomes a system that can impact one’s livelihood.

<ins>**Stakeholders**</ins>

**Direct Stakeholders:**
- Users: Millions of individuals spend time on various social media platforms. The diversity of digital social networks provides a niche
for just about every user to create, observe, or engage with content. The popularity of content gathers users together, creating online
communities.
- Social media companies: Social media companies create loose boundaries for their users to abide within. Using algorithms, they knowingly
or unknowingly promote or hide content to viewers that may agree or disagree with certain opinions within the corporations. These
companies also work with creators to push agendas and foster communities that encourage more users to join their platform.

**Indirect Stakeholders:**
- Government: When COVID hit, the spread of misinformation was a driving factor of the unnecessary loss of millions of lives. Major
social media platforms are privately owned and would therefore be responsible for handling the issue. However, it’s within the
jurisdiction of the government to address issues that interfere with ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’. With the
considerable loss of life, the government did take action in trying to stop the spread of misinformation.
- Environment.  The spread of information from social media can spread awareness of destructive environmental practices or agendas that
companies or lawmakers put into place. Users might be inspired to create change in their own lives through sustainability or even
protest and create change for a healthier planet.
- Society. Many of today’s shared experiences happen online today and fewer in person. As communities, connections, and information is
shared, societies are becoming more connected. As more people are engaging in the same experience, society will likely be impacted
by an something experienced by a large scale of people.

**Human Values:** The labeling of the seven deadly sins derives from Judeo-Christian roots in claiming what ‘sins’ separate one from god. The seven vices we’ll
be looking at are: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth. As consumers, we tend to gravitate towards services or products that align with our
values, needs, and wants. Many people spend hours a day on social media sites so much so that the amount of time spent has proven to negatively impact
individual and societal wellbeing. In regards to our topic, we explore how values are exploited through social media use for monetary gain.

<ins>**Potential Benefits and Harms:**</ins>

**Benefits:** The sins that the social media platform coincides with the user, giving the user a place to express themselves with other users who hold similar
values and goals as them. For companies, using the “optimal” sin for getting profit from their users and retaining users on their platform can be beneficial
for the longevity of their company

**Harms:** At the same time, the overuse of social media can cause mental and physical harm to its users. The use of our findings may encourage the exploitation
of certain vices for financial benefit and power over positive human values such as wellbeing.
#### Research questions
&nbsp;
<ins>**Of the seven deadly sins, which sin brings in the most users?**</ins>

The importance of this question is that the researcher will analyze data
from different social media platforms to learn what the dominant negative impact on the public in today’s society, and which type of sins have the most
impact on the public’s attention and action with their related news or other types of online resources. Second, after obtaining the results of this
research question, the researchers will be able to know the sins that bring the most users to their associated social networking sites, which will be the
most direct and largest stakeholder group. In addition, it is also possible for the researchers to know the name of the sponsors of the sites that cited the
“most popular” sins during the study, since they are likely to be non-direct stakeholders. Finally, on the level of human values, this research question is
related to inclusiveness and exclusivity, because the results of the study can show which types of sins are not rejected or even tolerated by the public.

<ins>**Which sin seems to generate the most annual accruing revenue for social media platforms? (greed or lust?)**</ins>

First, the importance of this question is that the researchers are able to find out which social media outlets are most likely to be attractive to users to consume the content posted in connection with the
sin. Second, in the process of finding the answer to this question, researchers may find other stakeholders besides the profitable social media platforms, in
this case more indirect ones. Of course, for social media platforms that cite sin to profit, studying this question can reveal a specific amount of profit
for this platform. Finally, speaking from the perspective of human values, we think what the social media platforms consider important is achievement aimed
at the profit side. But in achieving the ideal profits, the platforms may have neglected the human values of community, environmental sustainability, and
human dignity.

<ins>**Which sites are the best at their “sins?”**</ins>

In answering this question, we’ll be digging into the heart of the subject matter in asking how much
influence do companies have when using these vices for competitive advantage. In utilizing the dataset we will get a better understanding of financial,
economic, and social impacts. We can also reverse engineer the thought process and ask what would be the impacts if one of these companies didn’t exist. The
results may also show if there are certain sins that dominate the market over others. Furthermore, we could explore market trends and examine up and coming
companies that aim to take over the market through the usage of a less popular vice.

#### The dataset
[Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/#social-media-use-over-time) offers limited data on various social
media platforms regarding their demographics. This is a starting point but is lacking in fulfilling the number of observations needed.
Pew Research offers limited data on various social media platforms
regarding their demographics. This is a starting point but is lacking in fulfilling the number of observations needed.

The other dataset we will most likely use instead is data from pitchbook. Pitchbook is a company that records various financial and market data of privately owned companies and public companies. It is widely used in consulting, startup, and investing communities to evaluate companies and their competitors. Using Pitchbook we can compile the information of multiple social media companies and observe variables such as the investors, users, revenue, growth, employees etc. With this information we can begin to understand how profitable certain companies are when aligned with one of the deadly sins.
#### Expected implications
One implication we might observe from our study is how invested people are in social media. We’re aware that many people spend
possibly more time on social media than recommended. However, our study will examine that theory through quantitative data and visuals. Seeing our study, a
government agency might identify why people use a certain platform over another and recognize how much influence they can have through that channel. Another
implication we might have is we can know information overload better. All kinds of social media is a form of information. In fact, with the advent of various
social media, our brains can't handle the amount of information we receive every day. By analyzing the datasets of various social software, we can figure out
which software or platforms are the source of information overload, and how information overload affects our behaviors that are connected to the "sins".
#### Limitations
- Not all social media provides accurate data. Because of the advanced internet technology nowadays, data about social media from various sources
abound. We cannot guarantee that all websites are authoritative and worthy or reliable, so researchers need to be careful when selecting data to be studied
on the internet.
- Everyone's personal opinion on the so-called "sin" is different (in the eyes of some people the so-called sin may be just a part of daily
life) Since our survey contains something related to religion and not all people are religious people, it is possible that our survey will not apply to.
